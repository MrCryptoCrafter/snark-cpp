# ZK-SNARKS

## Overview

This library is a comprehensive implementation of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKS) in C++. It focuses on finite arithmetic operations for big integers utilizing the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP). The library is crafted to offer efficient and secure computations in cryptographic applications and includes custom implementations of Polynomial Arithmetic, Quadratic Arithmetic Programs (QAP), the Pinocchio Protocol, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography with bilinear pairing.

## Features

- **Polynomial Arithmetic**: Efficient operations on polynomials, fundamental in cryptographic computations.
- **Quadratic Arithmetic Programs (QAP)**: Framework for turning computation into a system of equations, crucial for ZK-SNARKS.
- **Pinocchio Protocol**: An advanced ZK-SNARKS protocol implementation ensuring non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.
- **Elliptic Curve with Bilinear Pairing**: Custom implementation of elliptic curves optimized for secure pairings.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (C++11 or higher)
- GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP)
