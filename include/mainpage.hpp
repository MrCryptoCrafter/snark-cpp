/**
 * @mainpage ZK-SNARKS Library
 *
 * @section overview Overview
 *
 * This library is a comprehensive implementation of Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKS) in C++. 
 * It focuses on finite arithmetic operations for big integers utilizing the GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (GMP). 
 * The library is crafted to offer efficient and secure computations in cryptographic applications and includes custom implementations 
 * of Polynomial Arithmetic, Quadratic Arithmetic Programs (QAP), the Pinocchio Protocol, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography with bilinear pairing.
 *
 * @section features Features
 *
 * - Polynomial Arithmetic: Efficient operations on polynomials, fundamental in cryptographic computations.
 * - Quadratic Arithmetic Programs (QAP): Framework for turning computation into a system of equations, crucial for ZK-SNARKS.
 * - Pinocchio Protocol: An advanced ZK-SNARKS protocol implementation ensuring non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs.
 * - Elliptic Curve with Bilinear Pairing: Custom implementation of elliptic curves optimized for secure pairings.
